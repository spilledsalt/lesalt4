This mod has many things that I have collected from other people's work, it would be difficult at this point to give 
the credits, but I have made this message to thank you for your indirect contribution to my mod

At the same time, I have also worked on my own things and of course, on the suffering of adapting what I have not devised. 
This is a MOD made for the community and with the aim of entertaining, making this clear, I want to avoid conflicts with anyone who tries to complain 
about something "not done" by me.

- Ame, developer and creator of the mod "Parabellum"
